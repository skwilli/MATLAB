Matlab code for coastal fluid mechanics

Files written by Susan K Willis, PhD, while writing dissertation at UC Berkeley, susan.k.willis@alum.berkeley.edu. Please contact with any questions.

Files are created in MATLAB 2012b, and common functions included in statistical toolboxes on MATLAB are used, as well as those widely available on the MATLAB File Exchange. 

Designed to be used with traditional near-shore oceanographic observational datasets, which can be very large, and easily manipulated as matrices. Typical datasets include temperature or density as a function of time (x, each column) and depth (y, each row); similarly structured velocity data from RDI ADCPs; similarly structure concurrent dissipation rate measurements from profiling instruments.
